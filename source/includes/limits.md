# Limits

There's really not a lot of them.

Here's a complete list:

- you need to have [Live Coin Watch account](https://www.livecoinwatch.com)
- each request is mapped to a single *credit*
- daily credit allowance is 10,000
- credits are renewed every UTC midnight
- you can check your API status at your [Profile page](https://www.livecoinwatch.com/profile)
- if you're using API in a public-facing manner, we require attribution that should consist of a link to [Live Coin Watch](https://www.livecoinwatch.com) in a legible font, and on the same and each screen or page Live Coin Watch API data is used. You can use our [Press kit](https://lcw.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mediakit.zip) to make it look nicer, if it helps.

There you go, that's all.

Have fun, be safe!
