# Errors

> Example end-point with JSON error information:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 418,
    "status": "I'm a teapot.",
    "description": "Yes, a teapot"
  }
}
```

Errors follow [There Is Only One Format](#there-is-only-one-format) as well.

<aside class="notice">
This doesn't mean HTTP end-points won't have the same status code assigned as well. We recommend you use error information from the JSON response though.
